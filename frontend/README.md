Rabbit Hole — Spotify-inspired concept frontend (Next.js). See `DESIGN-NOTES.md`
for the design system and its legal-safety record.

## Running locally — TWO servers

Rabbit Hole is a Next.js frontend over the existing Python engine (FastAPI). Run
both, from the repo root:

```bash
# 1. API (serves the engine on :8000)
python3 -m uvicorn api.main:app --port 8000

# 2. Frontend (this app on :3000; proxies /api/* -> :8000 via next.config rewrite)
cd frontend && npm run dev
```

Then open http://localhost:3000. This Next.js frontend + the FastAPI engine are
the whole app (the legacy Streamlit UI was retired in plan 010).

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
